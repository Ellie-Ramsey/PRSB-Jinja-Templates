Notes for Developer - Right Template Iterations:
In Ignore:
  old Template R = First ever jinja template, has the table and iteration create using ChatGPT however it has no formal structuring or if catches

  rightTemplate A = This was the first iteration of the template, it is not functional for general json templates as it has catch statements for specific values 

  rightTemaplet B = this is the iterative code which uses the indentation system, each further point in the json file is further indented

  treeTemplate = original tree template general, not turned into jinja

In GitHub:
  rightTemplate C = same as template B, however fomatting changed slightly by Chalrie to include bold + change the value placement

  rightTemplate D = current work in progress, further dveelopment for using a tress view instead
